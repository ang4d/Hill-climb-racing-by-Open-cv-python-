🖐️ Gesture-Controlled Hill Climb Racing 🚗
Control Hill Climb Racing using real-time hand gestures via OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python!

📸 Project Overview
This project enables you to control Hill Climb Racing (or any similar keyboard-controlled game) using your hand gestures via a webcam. It uses:

OpenCV for video capture and display,

MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking,

Pynput to simulate keyboard inputs based on your finger gestures.

💡 How It Works
The webcam captures your hand in real-time.

MediaPipe detects and tracks hand landmarks.

If 3 or more fingers are raised, the script presses the Right Arrow key (Accelerate).

If less than 3 fingers are raised, it presses the Left Arrow key (Brake).

If no hand is detected, both keys are released.

🎮 Controls
Hand Gesture	Action Triggered
3 or more fingers raised ✋	Accelerate (Right)
Less than 3 fingers raised 🤏	Brake (Left)
No hand in frame ❌	Stop (No input)

🧰 Tech Stack
🧠 MediaPipe – Hand detection and tracking

🎥 OpenCV – Video processing and visualization

⌨️ Pynput – Simulating keyboard input in real-time

🐍 Python – Core language for logic and integration

🚀 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-controlled-hill-climb.git
cd gesture-controlled-hill-climb
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed (3.7+ recommended). Then, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pynput
3. Run the Script
bash
Copy
Edit
python gesture_hill_climb.py
🚨 Make sure your webcam is working and the game is focused (active window) when running the script.

📷 Demo
Add a GIF or image here showing hand gesture controlling the game.

🛠️ Customization
You can adjust:

max_num_hands for multi-hand control.

Gesture logic (e.g., specific finger combinations).

Game key bindings (e.g., for other games).

🧠 Future Improvements
Add gesture-to-key mapping GUI.

Support for more games or multi-finger gesture customization.

Voice feedback or gesture recognition accuracy indicators.
